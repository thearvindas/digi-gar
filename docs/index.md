# my curiosities repo

### I built this primarily for three reasons:
- I'm just very curious about a lot of things. All the questions here are personal curiosities that I wanted answers for. 
- I research to find out answers and then document them here. Documenting them in public forces me to articulate and write with as clarity as I can. Ideally, someone with a similar curiousity should be read my answer and be satisfied.
- I like having my own space on the internet - a url I can send to others and say this is mine!
